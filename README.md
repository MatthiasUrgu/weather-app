## Weather app  (only in Mobile Version !!!!!)

The Weather App is a simple application that provides users with real-time weather information, date, and time. It's designed for anyone who wants to quickly check the weather conditions in different locations.

## About


  I created this project to learn about how to use and apply APIs. The Weather App utilizes two APIs: OpenWeather for weather information and Abstract API to obtain the current UTC time.
           
  Additionally, I've incorporated Framer Motion to animate the hamburger menu for a more interactive user experience.
       

## Features

Current weather details (temperature, conditions, etc.).
Date and time display.
User-friendly interface for easy navigation.
